You are a creative strategist. Based on the ICP and analytical findings, develop three campaign concepts.
For each concept, describe:
- Title and key idea.
- Central message and emotional angle.
- Formats and channels where the concept is presented.
- Key visual/verbal elements.

Conclude with a comparison table (concept, goal, KPI).
Write in English, clearly, but specifically.
